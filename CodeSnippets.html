138. More on async and await

async methods are different than normal methods. Whatever you return from async methods are wrapped in a Task.

If you return no value(void) it will be wrapped in Task, If you return int it will be wrapped in Task<int> and so on.

If your async method needs to return int you'd mark the return type of the method as Task<int> and you'll return plain int not the Task<int>. Compiler will convert the int to Task<int> for you.

private async Task<int> MethodName()
{
    await SomethingAsync();
    return 42;//Note we return int not Task<int> and that compiles
}
Sameway, When you return Task<object> your method's return type should be Task<Task<object>>

public async Task<Task<object>> MethodName()
{
     return Task.FromResult<object>(null);//This will compile
}
Since your method is returning Task, it shouldn't return any value. Otherwise it won't compile.

public async Task MethodName()
{
     return;//This should work but return is redundant and also method is useless.
}
Keep in mind that async method without an await statement is not async.

137. Wait for a void async method

Best practice is to mark function async void only if it is fire and forget method, if you want to await on, you should mark it as async Task.

135. AsNoTracking() 
AsNoTracking() allows the "unique key per record" requirement in EF to be bypassed (not mentioned explicitly by other answers). 
This is extremely helpful when reading a View that does not support a unique key because perhaps some fields are nullable or 
the nature of the view is not logically indexable.

131: Some programming languages timeline

Operating System	Programming Language Used
Mac OS X (Apple):	Object C, C
Windows (Microsoft):	C, C++, C#
Linux (Linus Torvalds):	C, Objective-C, Assembly language

Android:	Core (C) and Java (UI) ::::(Android app developers use: Kotlin or Java)
		(Kotlin is the preferred language for Android development in 2021. Both Java and Kotlin can be used to build performant, useful applications, but Google's libraries, tooling, documentation, and learning resources continue to embrace a Kotlin-first approach; making it the better language for Android today.)
		(Kotlin Application Deployment is faster to compile, lightweight, and prevents applications from increasing size. Any chunk of code written in Kotlin is much smaller compared to Java, as it is less verbose and less code means fewer bugs. Kotlin compiles the code to a bytecode which can be executed in the JVM.)
iOS: 		Built in (C++, C, objective C) :::: (iOS Developers use: Swift or Objective C) --- Mainly Objective C was used by developers, but later, Apple developed their own language and that is Swift. Swift is based on Objective C, C++ and C)
     		(As the performance of swift, it is 2.6x faster than Objective C and 8.4x faster than python. It got an encouraging syntax that make you write clean and consistent code. It provides improve readability and prevent errors.)

130. What is a Transaction in SQL Server?
A transaction in SQL Server is a group of SQL statements that are treated as a single unit and they are executed by applying the principle “do everything or do nothing” and a successful transaction must pass the ACID test.

What are ACID Properties of a Transaction?
In the context of transaction processing, the acronym ACID refers to the four key properties of a transaction, such as

Atomicity
Consistency
Isolation
Durability.

Both these methods are used to convert a value to a string. The difference is Convert.ToString() method handles null whereas the ToString() doesn’t handle null in C#.

128. TRUNCATE a TABLE

Best way to clear a table is with TRUNCATE.

Since you are creating and droping ill assume you have no constraints.

TRUNCATE TABLE <target table>
Some advantages:

Less transaction log space is used.
The DELETE statement removes rows one at a time and records an entry in the transaction log for each deleted row. TRUNCATE TABLE removes the data by deallocating the data pages used to store the table data and records only the page deallocations in the transaction log.

Fewer locks are typically used.
When the DELETE statement is executed using a row lock, each row in the table is locked for deletion. TRUNCATE TABLE always locks the table (including a schema (SCH-M) lock) and page but not each row.

Without exception, zero pages are left in the table.
After a DELETE statement is executed, the table can still contain empty pages. For example, empty pages in a heap cannot be deallocated without at least an exclusive (LCK_M_X) table lock. If the delete operation does not use a table lock, the table (heap) will contain many empty pages. For indexes, the delete operation can leave empty pages behind, although these pages will be deallocated quickly by a background cleanup process.

Now that C# 7 has been released, you can use the new included Tuples syntax

(string, string, string) LookupName(long id) // tuple return type
{
    ... // retrieve first, middle and last from data storage
    return (first, middle, last); // tuple literal
}

<!--123--So my question is how to create 2 DbSets with same generic type, in DbContext class.---->

You have to use a base class that is not used as a DbSet and inherit from that in the classes you will use as a DbSet.

If you use an inherited class - e.g. FlightBase in the below example - in a DbSet, tables for Flight and ArchiveFlight will not be generated.

Classes

public class FlightBase
{
    // code
}

public class Flight : FlightBase { }

public class ArchiveFlight : FlightBase { }
DbContext

public class FlightsDatabase : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Flight> Flights { get; set; }
    public DbSet<ArchiveFlight> ArchiveFlights { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Passanger> Passengers { get; set; }
}
